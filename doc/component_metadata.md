# Component metadata

Here you can find additional information about the different properties that must be contained in the metadata object of the component.

## `name`

The name of the component. It must match the name of the containing folder.

## `icon`

The name of the icon file to use for the component. The icon must be in the `icons` folder in the root of the repository. Only SVG files are supported. See [here](./icons.md) for more detail about the icon formats.

## `inputs`

It should contain an array of input objects. Each object must have the following properties:

```
{
    name: the identifier of the parameter. Must be unique. Avoid special characters and blank spaces. The name of the parameter will be used as the name of the SQL variable that will contain the value selected by the user, so it should be a valid SQL variable name,
    title: the human-readable description of the name,
    description: optional. A longer description of the parameter
}
```

These are the available types to be used. Notice that some of them have additional properties apart from the ones mentioned above:

-   `Table`
    ```json
    {
        "name": "inputtable",
        "title": "Input table",
        "description": "The input table",
        "type": "Table"
    }
    ```
-   `Boolean`
    ```json
    {
        "name": "converttometers",
        "title": "Convert to meters",
        "description": "Convert values to meters",
        "type": "Boolean"
    }
    ```
-   `String`
    ```json
    {
        "name": "selectstatement",
        "title": "SELECT statement",
        "description": "The SELECT statement to run",
        "type": "String"
    }
    ```
-   `Number` (it accepts `min`, `max` and `default` properties)

    ```json
    {
        "name": "distance",
        "title": "Distance",
        "description": "The buffer distance",
        "type": "number"
    }
    ```

-   `Selection`
    ```json
    {
        "name": "units",
        "title": "Units",
        "description": "Units to use",
        "type": "Selection",
        "options": ["meters", "miles"]
    }
    ```
-   `Column`
    ```json
    {
        "name": "geocol",
        "title": "Geo column",
        "description": "The column containing geometries",
        "type": "Column",
        "parent": "source_table"
    }
    ```

## `outputs`

It should contain an array of output elements. Since outputs generated by workflow components can only be tables, an output element is defined just like an input table element. For instance:

```json
{
    "name": "outputtable",
    "title": "Output table",
    "description": "The output table",
    "type": "Table"
}
```

## `cartoEnvVars`

You can include an array with the list of environmental variables that your component will need. Those variables will be automatically declared and assigned, and you will have them available to be used in your component code.

These are the variables that are currently supported:

-   `analyticsToolboxDataset`
-   `analyticsToolboxVersion`
-   `apiBaseUrl`
-   `accessToken`
-   `dataExportDefaultGCSBucket`
-   `bigqueryProjectId`
-   `bigqueryRegion`

The property is not optional, so, in case you don't need environment variables in your component, use an empty array.
