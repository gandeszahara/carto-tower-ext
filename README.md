# Extension Packages for CARTO Workflows
Use this template repository as a framework for creating extension packages for CARTO Workflows, containing custom components that are tailored to your specific use cases. 

These packages can be easily distributed and installed within the Workflows application, extending its core functionality with new, specialized operations.
